# Custom theme for zsh

This is a (slightly) modified agnoster theme.

## Set up

> You need to have `brew`, `zsh`, and `oh-my-zsh` installed.

1. Copy the custom theme in the zsh custom themes location.

2. Install [Cascadia Code PowerLine](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/font-cascadia-code-pl#default) font.

3. Use the dark theme of your terminal.
